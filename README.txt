This directory used to carry the RPM auto-Provides and auto-Requires scripts for
KDE Plasma developed as part of the Google Summer of Code 2011 project by Kevin
Kofler. They were now merged into the kde-settings trunk. You can find the
current versions of the scripts under trunk/usr/lib/rpm in this repository.
